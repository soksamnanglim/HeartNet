**Summary**: Researchers used a convolutional neural network to achieve 96% accuracy classifying Generalized Anterorior Myocardial Infarction in data from 4 ECG leads.  To combine data from multiple leads in the diagnosis, sub-2d convolutional layers and lead asymmetric pooling layers were used. The algorithm’s realtime performance was tested on a lightweight embedded system and found to be suitable for application in mobile wearable ECG devices.

**Publication**: July 2019 in IEEE Access
**Summary**: Researchers used a CNN to detect STEMI on 12-lead ECGs, optimizing its performance via two main data pre-processing techniques: noise reduction (notch filter and high pass filter) and pulse segmentation (via QRS complex detection). Each preprocessing technique increased the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), enhancing STEMI detection performance on the dataset (275 ECG records (179 STEMI, 96 normal) from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital). The proposed algorithm extends existing CNN architecture.

**Summary**: Study combines image-based approach with deep learning techniques to improve detection accuracy of ST depression change, an important marker for detecting myocardial ischemia, in ECGs. The convolutional neural network created yields an average area under the curve (AUC) at 89.6% from an independent testing set. It yields a mean sensitivity at 84.4% and a specificity at 84.9% at selected optimal cutoff thresholds.

**Publication**: August 2020 in Nature
**Summary**: The researchers use a ML fusion model of (Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)) to predict underlying acute myocardial ischemia in patients with chest pain. Using 554 temporal-spatial features of the 12-lead ECG from a sample size of 1244 patients over amplitude changes, the model achieves a 52% gain in sensitivity over commercial software and 37% gain over experienced clinicians. Study reinforced that linear classifiers like LR are as effective as complex ANN, which lends the use of linear classification favorability in clinical practice as neural networks are a complete black-box to physicians and thus stigmatized.
